# Portfolio
This is my collected work experience over the years.
# About me
I am an open-minded and motivated person who seek to continue learning and learn from mistakes. First, I am an well organized person who have experienced in Data managing and research background. This results in a skill for attention to detail and able to take responsiblities on tight schedules. I have a problem-solving skill which are developed from my research background and customer service. I have been working as a customer service/QA for over 4 and a half year. On the other hands, I have also gain experience in research work on Coivid19 and ADPKD.

I have got a master degree in school health where I have gained experience in public health. My research focused on mental health in students which significantly contribute to the research data among young children where they first experience high amount of stress as a young school age. The topic has not been done in Thailand up to this point.

Currently, I wish to use my research experience and data collection to join a gaming community once again in the QA position where I can work with a work I have great experience in and work that I enjoy doing.

It would be a great experience for me to become a QA tester to gain more experience in the mid to senior level in the company.
